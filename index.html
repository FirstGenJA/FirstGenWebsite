                    Formed in April 2024, SLC NextGen JA emerged after Senate Bill 272 passed and news broke about the NHL and Sports Entertainment, Culture, and Convention District. As a group of friends who grew up attending temple and church events on Japantown Street, we got together to discuss how we could help advocate and organize our community efforts to preserve and revitalize Japantown. We gathered community leaders to address how these changes impact Japantown and to ensure our voices are heard in the revitalization of Downtown.                </p>

                <small>1890s-1960s</small>
                <p>Japantown started to grow around 1910 after the first Japanese arrived in the late 1800s to work on the railroads and farms. It would continue to grow before World War II, and despite the setbacks to the community during the war, Japantown recovered and remained the heart of the Japanese American community into the 1960s.

                <h2>The Dispersion</h2>
                <small>1960s</small>
                <p>Through eminent domain and the seizing of 90 Japanese Americans-owned or operated businesses, the move to create a new convention space, the Salt Palace, decimated Japantown. Only the Salt Lake Buddhist Temple and Japanese Church of Christ remained on 100 South.

                <small>1990s-2010s</small>
                <p>The Japanese Community Preservation Committee (JCPC) was formed to advocate for creating and preserving a garden as a buffer between the Salt Palace and the Japanese Church of Christ. As a part of this effort, 100 S. was officially named Japantown Street, and plans were made to redesign the streetscape to reflect Japantown.</p>
